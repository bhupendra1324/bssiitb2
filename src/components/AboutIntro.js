            In 2017, after working for a year in the IT industry as a software
            engineer I took a very bold step to quit my job and venture into the
            field of research at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
            Initially I worked in the field of statistical based reliability
            estimation of mechanical equipment, but later worked with Machine
            Learning with one of our projects. After some serious
            self-reflection about my passions and interests, I committed to
            learning everything about Machine Learning. Deep Learning and
            everything related to deploying predictive models to the servers.

            Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Master in Geoinformatics from Indian
            Institute of Technology, Bombay. Here I am working in the area of
            Super Resolution and Few Shot Learning of Hyperspectral Satellite
            Imaging. For my masters thesis, I am working on Domain Adaptive Few
            Shot Learning of Hyperspectral Satellite Imaging.
